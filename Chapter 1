# Introduction to C++ Programming

## Objectives
Upon finishing this chapter, students will have the capability to:
1. Identify basic components of a C++ program, including functions, special symbols, and identifiers
2. Classify simple data types and use them in assignment statements
3. Use arithmetic operators, precedence, and expressions
4. Create assignment and input statements and the use of variables within statements.
5. Differentiate between type conversion and type casting
6. Develop output results using output statements
7. Identify syntax errors and debugging techniques
8. Write a basic C++ program

## Introduction

In this chapter, we'll learn the essential basics of C++ programming. It’s like building blocks for people 
who want to become programmers. We’ll start by understanding the main parts of a C++ program, like functions,
special symbols,and identifiers. Functions are like building blocks of code that help organize things better. Special symbols and 
identifiers are like names for things in the program, making it easier to work with data.

Next, we'll talk about data types and assignment statements in C++. This is important for keeping and changing different kinds of
information. When programmers learn how to use simple data types in assignment statements, it helps them start and change variables 
easily. We’ll also look at math symbols, their importance, and how to create complicated math calculations in C++ programs.

Now, we'll look at how to produce input and output to users. Dealing with what users type and arranging how information is displayed 
are essential skills for making programs that are easy for people to use. We also talk about changing the data type and casting it, 
understanding when and why to do it to keep data accurate. Finally, we find and fix common mistakes in how the program is written 
and explore ways to ensure the program runs smoothly.

This chapter provides activities with hands-on problems that will allow readers to write their own basic C++ program to make sure 
they understand these concepts.

Output results using output statements
Output results are the result of running your code and asking for a result. You can tell your code to add 2 + 2 = y, without an output statment the result 4 would not be sent.

Consider the following

#include <isostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int y:
  y = 2;
return 0;
}

Without an output satement this code just stores 2 into y, so the end user does not know what is stored. Before moving on attempt to add an output statement.

The code WITH and output statment reads:
#include <isostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int y:
  y = 2;
cout << y << endl
return 0;
}

Syntax Errors and Debugging Techneqiues 
Syntax errors occur because you violate the conventions of c++. Think of it like the grammar and punctuation, a sentence may make sense to you as a human but without the correct grammatical conventions it means nothing. Syntax errors can be caused by improper use of semicolons and brackets, not declaring variables correctly, forgetting quotes for strings, and many other things. 

Condsider the following code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
double x;
int n;
    
x = 3
n = 2

  double answer = pow(x, n);

cout << answer

return 0;


This code contains several syntax errors, it is intended to take a base and an exponenet and find the result. Try to fix it before moving on.

The following must be corrected in order to run this code:

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>   // The cmath library is required to use the "pow" function below
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  double x;
  int n;
    
  x = 3;  // Semicolons are required after each line 
  n = 2;

  double answer = pow(x, n);

  cout << answer << endl // endl is required to indicate when the code ends

return 0;
} // A bracket is required to tell the computer what its expexcted to read

The corrected code reads:

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> 
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  double x;
  int n;
    
  x = 3;
  n = 2;

  double result = pow(x, n);

  cout << result << endl;

  return 0;
}

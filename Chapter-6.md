### Identify the purpose of arrays

Arrays allow a program to specify how many variables must be declared, their data type, and other values with a much simpler statement. An array is a collection of a fixed number of components all of the same data type and in the same memory space. A one-dimensional array is an array in which the components are arranged in a list form. The purpose of arrays is to provide a way to store and access multiple values of the same data type under a single name.

### Declare and initialize arrays

The general form for declaring a one-dimensional array is:


dataType arrayName[intExp];
intExp specifies the number of components in the array and can be any constant expression that evaluates to a positive integer.

The general form (syntax) used for accessing an array component


arrayName[indexExp]
indexExp, called the index, is any expression whose value is a nonnegative integer.

I. Recognizing the Power of Repetition

Outcome 1: Explain the core concept of repetition in programming.
Outcome 2: Identify real-world scenarios where repetition control structures streamline code.
Outcome 3: Compare the efficiency of code written with and without repetition structures.

1. Repetition in programming is the basic ability to perfrom a block a code multiple times based on a condition that hass been set by the programmer. This allows the program to
   automatically perform task with the same set of insctrctions without having to rewrite the code however many times is need. All in all it is a time saver.

II. Demystifying While Loops

Outcome 1: Construct basic while loops with correct initialization, condition checking, and updates.
Outcome 2: Differentiate between for loops, do-while loops, and EOF-controlled loops, using examples.
Outcome 3: Modify loops to iterate a specific number of times or until a user-defined condition is met.
III. Conditional Logic: Controlling Flow with If and Else

Outcome 1: Write 'if' statements to implement decision-making within loops.
Outcome 2: Incorporate 'else' and 'else if' statements to create multi-branch conditional logic.
Outcome 3: Apply nested 'if' statements to handle complex decision scenarios within loops.
IV. Manipulating Loop Behavior: Break and Continue

Outcome 1: Demonstrate the use of 'break' to prematurely exit a loop.
Outcome 2: Apply 'continue' to skip the remaining portion of a loop iteration and advance to the next.
Outcome 3: Design scenarios where the strategic use of 'break' and 'continue' enhances code readability and efficiency.
V. Nesting Control Structures: Loops within Loops

Outcome 1: Create nested loops to solve problems requiring multiple levels of iteration.
Outcome 2: Control the execution flow of nested loops effectively to achieve the desired outcome.
Outcome 3: Debug nested loops with multi-dimensional iteration patterns.
VI. Debugging Strategies: Perfecting Your Loops

Outcome 1: Identify common logical errors arising in repetition control structures.
Outcome 2: Utilize debugging tools to trace code execution and locate the source of errors within loops.
Outcome 3: Develop preventive coding practices to minimize the occurrence of logic errors in loops.
